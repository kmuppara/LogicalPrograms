Zero downtime credential ration 
Existing Approach:  As per discover audit norms database user credentials have to be rotated on regular/yearly basis. These new credentials have to be updated in PCF and Non PCF applications. Flow/process for updating credentials:
For PCF apps: stop app -> rotate credentials -> update in vault -> update environment variables -> restart app.
For Non PCF apps: stop app -> rotate credentials -> update environment variables -> restart app.	
This process is partially or not automated in the Discover and Dinersclub applications.
Disadvantages: Applications downtime, Database user locks, Manual intervention, process documentation efforts. 
New Proposal:
The entire process will be converted as one click rotation. Application owner has to pass organization and database user as input parameters.
All the services which are using this database user will be updated with new credentials and notification will be triggered with 
services and database user health status.
Technologies: ServiceNow, Jenkins, Linux, Vault, AIM, Spring, Java.
