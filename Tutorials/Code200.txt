Zero downtime credential ration 
Existing Approach:  As per discover audit norms database user credentials have to be rotated on regular/yearly basis. These new credentials have to be updated in PCF and Non PCF applications. Flow/process for updating credentials:
For PCF apps: stop app -> rotate credentials -> update in vault -> update environment variables -> restart app.
For Non PCF apps: stop app -> rotate credentials -> update environment variables -> restart app.	
This process is partially or not automated in the Discover and Dinersclub applications.
Disadvantages: Applications downtime, Database user locks, Manual intervention, process documentation efforts. 
New Proposal: This entire process can be automated with two keys approach for each database user.
