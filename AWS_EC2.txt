#AWS EC2 cloud server instance access steps (AIForChange Hackathon by Capg)

Connect to your AWS instance:
Open Git bash and execute below commands::

1.  cd /Users/your_username/Downloads/< your .pem filename> 
    Note: .pem file will be generated while creating AWS EC2 instance.

2.  chmod 0400 <your .pem filename>

3.  ssh -L localhost:8888:localhost:8888 -i <your .pem filename> ubuntu@

4.  In the terminal, use the command: jupyter notebook

Note:
* We have used anaconda environment management package while creating EC2 instance.
* It provides access to Pandas, TensorFlow, Jupyter Notebook and many inbuilt tools.
